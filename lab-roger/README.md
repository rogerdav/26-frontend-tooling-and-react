#26-frontend-tooling-and-react

This app uses react, it will teach us how to use react, install the correct dependencies and populate a dom element with react-dom. This will dynamically use the div with the id of root. As a starting point.



### Installing

All that is necessary is to type
```npm install```  
That will install the required dependencies.
